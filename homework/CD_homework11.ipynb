QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models).

We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT.

              "  AIMessage(content='QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) is an efficient finetuning approach in machine learning that reduces memory usage while preserving performance. It involves backpropagating gradients through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank Adapters (LoRA). QLoRA has been used to finetune large language models with billions of parameters on relatively small GPUs, leading to state-of-the-art results.\\n\\nOne of the papers related to QLoRA is titled \"QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs\" by Tim Dettmers, Artidoro Pagnoni, Ari Holtzman, and Luke Zettlemoyer. The paper presents QLoRA as an approach to finetune large language models efficiently, achieving high performance with reduced memory usage. The authors introduce innovations such as 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4) data type and double quantization to save memory without sacrificing performance.\\n\\nTim Dettmers, one of the authors of the QLoRA paper, focuses on making foundation models like ChatGPT accessible by reducing their resource requirements.
